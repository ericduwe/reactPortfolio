              Iâ€™m a full-stack JavaScript developer with a professional
              background in project management. I have my undergraduate degrees
              in Economics and International Studies from the University of
              Wisconsin-Madison, and a Certificate in Full Stack Web Development
              from Southern Methodist University. My life has taken me in many
              different directions -- from music school to non-profit campaign
              management to web design and coding. I've always had a passion for
              creating things and I'm always looking forward to new endeavors. I
              live in Dallas with my partner and our three dogs: Remy, Maxy, and
              Flint.
