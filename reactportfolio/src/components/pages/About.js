            <h3>Bio</h3> 
            <p id="about-me-text">I’m a full-stack JavaScript developer with a professional background in project management.
            I have a pair of Bachelor's Degrees in Economics and International Studies from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and I’m currently working towards a Certificate in Full-Stack Web Development from Southern Methodist University. My life has taken me in many different directions -- from music school to non-profit campaign management to web design and development; from the cold winters of Central Wisconsin to the hot summers of North Texas. I've always had a passion for creating things and I'm always looking forward to new endeavors. I live in Dallas with my partner and our three dogs: Remy, Maxy, and Flint.</p>
